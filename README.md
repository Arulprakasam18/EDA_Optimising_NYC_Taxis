# NYC Taxi Trip Data Analysis ðŸš–  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes NYC taxi trip data to uncover demand patterns, fare trends, operational inefficiencies, and customer behaviors. The insights help optimize fleet deployment, pricing strategies, and service quality.  

## Key Analyses  
- **Temporal Trends:** Identifies peak hours (5-7 PM) and low-demand periods.  
- **Financial Insights:** Examines fare distribution, tip patterns, and revenue trends.  
- **Geographical Analysis:** Maps high-demand zones like airports and Midtown.  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Detects slow routes and pickup/dropoff imbalances.  
- **Pricing Strategy:** Compares vendor fares, surcharges, and per-mile costs.  
- **Customer Behavior:** Analyzes tipping trends and payment method preferences.  

## Findings  
- **Peak Demand:** Highest during **rush hours (5-7 PM) and late nights (8-11 PM).**  
- **High-Demand Zones:** **JFK, LaGuardia, Midtown, Penn Station, and Times Square.**  
- **Fare vs. Tip Relationship:** **Shorter trips get higher tip percentages; longer trips see lower tips.**  
- **Digital Payments:** **75% of transactions are credit card-based.**  
- **Surcharges Impact Pricing:** Applied **more frequently at night and in congested areas.**  

## Recommendations  
âœ” **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjust fares based on demand and congestion.  
âœ” **Fleet Optimization:** Increase availability in peak zones and hours.  
âœ” **Customer Incentives:** Discounts for off-peak travel, loyalty programs.  
âœ” **Driver Strategy:** Improve service quality to boost tips on longer trips.  
âœ” **Data-Driven Dispatching:** Use predictive analytics for demand forecasting.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geopandas)**  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
- **Geospatial Analysis**  
- **Statistical Correlation & Predictive Insights**  

## How to Use  
1. Load and clean taxi trip data.  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
3. Visualize trends and generate insights.  
4. Implement recommendations to optimize taxi services.  

## Future Work  
- **Real-time trip data integration.**  
- **Advanced machine learning for demand prediction.**  
- **Automated surge pricing recommendations.**  
- **Customer sentiment analysis from ride feedback.**
